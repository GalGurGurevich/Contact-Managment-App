# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Developer Notes
- I haven't focused on syling the app snice it's mostly time consuming
- the google API key was expired so I used a work-around in the code
- Folder structure is missing due to size of project, could be added
